              We believe in something really basic and straightforward. <br/>
              We took a step back and looked at how people listen to music on a daily
              basis. Music has never left them, whether they're having a decent
              day or going through a difficult time. <br/>
              Blockchain has propelled us to the next level of imaginable futures. Where you may simply go
              about your everyday activities while listening to music and
              earning money by using Streami-fi.
